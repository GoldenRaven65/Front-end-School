    <h1>Years 0-3</h1>
    <p>I was born in Delft-The netherlands, when i was born i lived in Monster I lived there until 1 was 3 years old, we had to move because i was starting to need some space<br>
    I can't remember much about that because i was just a baby.</p>
    <h1>Years 3-12</h1>
    <p>We moved to Poeldijk. I went to primary school there, at a school called "de nieuwe weg". I had a wonderful time there<br>
      I met alot of wonderful people and made alot of friends there, since a few weeks ago i have contact again with some of my old friends from back then<br>
     I also had a theater play at the end of the 8 years there, i played as a robot and it was so much fun</p>
